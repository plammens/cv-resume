Graduated with a master's degree in pure mathematics after a bachelor's degree in maths \& computing science.
Looking for a job in industry including roles such as data scientist, software engineer, machine learning engineer, researcher, or similar,
but also open to non-technical roles.
My long-term vision is to work on AI safety.

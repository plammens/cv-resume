Looking for a job in industry including roles such as data scientist, software/ML/AI engineer,
researcher, but also open to non-technical roles.
My long-term vision is to work on AI safety.
I am curious about entrepreneurship.


I also have a longstanding passion for music:
I have played the cello for over two decades and have dabbled in other instruments.
I have played and sung in several orchestras and choirs.

I combine formal training in pure mathematics with hands‑on experience building software and analysing data.
This gives me a strong ability to both reason abstractly and translate formal models into reliable, maintainable code.
Currently, my long-term vision is having a positive societal impact through work in AI safety.
I also have a longstanding passion for music, having participated in several orchestras and choirs.

I want to have a positive impact with my career, and my long-term vision to do so is to work on AI safety.
Also curious about entrepreneurship.
As a next step to develop my skills, I am looking for a job in industry
including roles such as data scientist, software/ML/AI engineer,
researcher, but I am also open to non-technical roles.


I have a longstanding passion for music:
I have played the cello for over two decades, dabbled in other instruments,
and have played and sung in several orchestras and choirs.
